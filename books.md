Voice applications improve the way users interact with these assistants, whether they are asking for the weather, requesting sports scores or listening to music.
This book will guide you in designing, and building voice-based applications for Alexa. Inside, you'll learn how to develop your own Skills, Amazon's term for voice apps that are running in Alexa.
