# VozTech

 ![image](/assets/img/podcasts/voztech.jpg)

The go-to tech podcast on voice assistants. A vision of the world of voice assistants from the inside out. We will talk about the most relevant news, we will make reviews and above all, we will talk about how they are programming. The link between all these topics will always be the same, the voice assistants (Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri, etc.).
